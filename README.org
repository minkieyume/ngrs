#+TITLE: README

* Discusstion
NGRS is a New Rust bindings for GNU Guile Scheme.

* Overview
`ngrs` provides both low-level raw bindings and high-level safe abstractions for embedding GNU Guile Scheme in Rust applications. This project enables seamless integration of Scheme scripting capabilities into Rust programs with a focus on memory safety and ergonomic APIs.

* Project Structure
The project is organized as a Cargo workspace with the following modules:

- **raw-guile** - Low-level FFI bindings to Guile's C API
- **guile** - High-level safe Rust wrappers with idiomatic interfaces
- **Root crate** - Re-exports both modules for convenient access

* Features

* Quick Start
#+begin_src rust
use ngrs::guile::{Runtime, with_guile};

fn main() {
    // Initialize Guile
    Runtime::initialize();
      
    with_guile(|vm:Runtime| {
        // Your Code Here
        println!("Hello guile from Rust!");
        let args = vec!["Test Guile".to_string(),];
        vm.shell(args);
    });
}
#+end_src

** Initialization
Before using any Guile functionality, you must initialize the Guile environment:

#+begin_src rust
use ngrs::guile::Runtime

fn main() {
    // Initialize Guile
    Runtime::initialize();

    // Your code here
}
#+end_src

*** Using with `init`
This way has Less platforms support.
#+begin_src rust
use ngrs::guile::Runtime;

fn main() {
    Runtime::initialize();
    let runtime = Runtime::new();

    // Your Guile-dependent code here
}
#+end_src

*** Using with `with_guile`
For more control over the Guile context:
#+begin_src rust
use ngrs::guile::with_guile;

fn main() {
    Runtime::initialize();

    with_guile(|vm:Runtime| {
        // Your Guile-dependent code here
    });
}
#+end_src
